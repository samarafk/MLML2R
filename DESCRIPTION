Description: An implementation of the EM-algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood 
    estimates (MLE) of the levels of 5-mC and 5-hmC in the DNA using information 
    from BS-conversion, TAB-conversion, and oxBS-conversion methods. 
    One can use information from all three methods or any combination of two of them. 
    Exact constrained MLE option is also available for combination of two methods.
