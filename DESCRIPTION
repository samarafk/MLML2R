Description: Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the levels of 5-mC and 5-hmC 
    in the DNA using information from BS-conversion, TAB-conversion, 
    and oxBS-conversion methods. One can use information from all three methods 
    or any combination of two of them. Estimates are based on Binomial model.
